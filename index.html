    <p>
           
        I am a huge fan of music, music festivals and live shows.
        I've fronted a number of bands as a blues/jazz/soul vocalist, 
        but since moving to Colorado in 2011, I've taken a break from the music scene 
        and focused on writing my own at home. I occasionally find time to jam with other
        musicians and it makes my soul happy. I currently work as an Educational admin/project manager
        with an incredible, national association for massage therapy.
        I work really closely with our IS department and am so looking forward to 
        becoming a web developer and moving into their department.<br>
        Here's to a successful 6-month program and an amazing new career!
