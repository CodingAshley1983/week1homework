                        <p>
                            I am a huge fan of music, music festivals and live shows.
                            I've fronted a number of bands as a blues/jazz/soul vocalist. I play guitar, piano and ukulele,
                            and this past summer I added "cigar-box" guitar to my instrumental repetoire when I built an electric guitar
                            out of an 800 page book. I can't wait to make the next one! <br><br>

                            I'm originally from Upstate NY (nowhere near NYC!) and moved to Denver in 2011. I've taken an unintentional hiatus
                            from the music scene and focused on writing my own at home. I occasionally find time to jam with other
                            musicians and it makes my soul happy. I currently work as an Educational admin/project manager
                            with an incredible, national association for massage therapy.<br>
                            <br>
                            I work really closely with our IS department and am so looking forward to 
                            becoming a web developer and moving into their department.<br>
                            Here's to a successful 6-month program and an amazing new career!
